# Learning Goals

By the end of this class meeting students will:

1. Be comfortable editing and annotating code in Jupyter notebooks
2. Be able to articulate the value of modular code structure.
3. Be able to write a simple unit test
4. Have practiced turning "procedural" code into "functional" code.

# What we'll be doing

* We will have a short introduction to Jupyter notebooks [20 min]
* We'll have a brief lecture about the value of modular code structure and testing [20 min]
* Students will take the spaghetti code and begin to turn it into a code organized into functions with tests
